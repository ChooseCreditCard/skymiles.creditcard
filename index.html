      Best Cards for Earning SkyMiles
    </a>
  </section>

  <!-- 1. What the program is -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>1. What the SkyMiles Program Is</h2>
    <p>
      SkyMiles is the frequent-flyer program of Delta Air Lines. Members earn miles when they fly with Delta or selected
      partners, and when they use Delta-linked credit cards and partners on the ground. Miles can then be redeemed for
      flights, upgrades and other travel-related rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most airline programs, SkyMiles combines:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>A mileage currency</strong> for redemptions on Delta and partner flights.</li>
      <li><strong>Elite status tiers</strong> that unlock extra benefits such as priority services and preferred seats.</li>
      <li><strong>Co-branded credit cards</strong> that tie everyday spending into the SkyMiles ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 2. How miles are earned -->
  <section id="earning" class="section">
    <h2>2. How SkyMiles Are Earned</h2>
    <p>SkyMiles can be earned through several channels:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Delta-operated flights</strong> – miles typically based on the fare you pay and your elite status level.</li>
      <li><strong>Partner airline flights</strong> – flights on eligible partners credited to your SkyMiles account.</li>
      <li><strong>Co-branded credit cards</strong> – miles on every dollar spent, with higher earn rates in certain categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Hotels, car rentals and shopping</strong> – partner activity where you enter your SkyMiles number.</li>
      <li><strong>Promotions</strong> – occasional limited-time offers with bonus miles on specific routes or partners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For many members, the majority of miles over time come from credit card spend rather than from flying itself.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3. How cards boost earnings -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. How Credit Cards Boost SkyMiles Earnings</h2>
    <p>
      Delta-branded credit cards allow you to earn SkyMiles on everyday expenses. Depending on your market, typical card
      features include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Miles on all purchases</strong>, often with elevated earn rates on Delta purchases, restaurants or groceries.</li>
      <li><strong>Welcome bonuses</strong> after you spend a required minimum within a set time period.</li>
      <li><strong>Flight perks</strong> such as priority boarding, free checked bags or companion certificates.</li>
      <li><strong>Status-related boosts</strong>, where spending can help you qualify for or keep higher tiers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By routing your normal spending through the right card, you can build a SkyMiles balance even in years where you fly less.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. Redemption categories -->
  <section id="redeem" class="section">
    <h2>4. Redemption Categories in SkyMiles</h2>
    <p>
      SkyMiles uses dynamic pricing rather than a simple fixed award chart, but the main redemption categories are:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Delta flights</strong> – one-way or return tickets paid partly or fully with miles.</li>
      <li><strong>Partner flights</strong> – redemptions on selected alliance and non-alliance partners.</li>
      <li><strong>Seat upgrades</strong> – upgrades from economy into higher cabins on some itineraries.</li>
      <li><strong>Vacation packages and extras</strong> – in some markets, miles can offset packages or add-ons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The value you get per mile can vary widely. Many travelers aim to use SkyMiles for flights rather than small
      purchases or merchandise.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. Elite tiers -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. SkyMiles Elite Status Tiers</h2>
    <p>
      SkyMiles has several elite status levels that provide additional perks when you fly Delta and selected partners.
      Names, metrics and requirements may change over time, but the general structure is:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>General Member</strong> – basic earning and redemption without extra perks.</li>
      <li><strong>Silver Medallion</strong> – entry-level elite with some priority and upgrade opportunities.</li>
      <li><strong>Gold Medallion</strong> – stronger upgrade priority and additional travel benefits.</li>
      <li><strong>Platinum Medallion</strong> – higher upgrade priority and more flexible benefits.</li>
      <li><strong>Diamond Medallion</strong> – top published tier with the most generous perks and recognition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some co-branded cards can help you on the way to these tiers by providing boosts, waiver options or extra earning
      on the metrics that qualify you for status.
