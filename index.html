    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Frequent-Flyer Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A frequent-flyer or airline-linked credit card is tied to an airline or travel program; spending with the card earns airline miles or points rather than generic cashback or standard reward points. These miles can later be redeemed for flights, upgrades, lounge access, or other travel-related benefits.</p>
      <p>Such cards are typically best suited for people who travel regularly — especially with the same airline or alliance. Everyday purchases convert into miles, gradually building toward reward tickets or premium travel perks.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning Mechanics -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How You Earn Miles With a Frequent-Flyer Card</h2>
      <p>Each purchase earns a set number of miles, often with bonus rates for travel-related spend like airfare, hotels, rental cars, or dining. Some cards may also offer periodic sign-up bonuses or promotional multipliers for certain categories.</p>
      <p>Since miles are tied to an airline’s reward program, you might also get additional travel-related perks — such as priority boarding, free baggage, companion tickets or status credits — depending on how the card program is structured.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming & Value -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles & What Impacts Value</h2>
      <p>Miles from frequent-flyer cards can typically be redeemed for free or discounted flights, seat upgrades, hotel stays (in some cases), or additional airline perks. The value you get per mile depends on route, season, seat class and availability — using miles for premium-class tickets or peak-season flights often delivers better value per mile.</p>
      <p>But frequent-flyer redemptions often come with trade-offs like blackout dates, limited availability, taxes and surcharges. Before applying, it’s crucial to check redemption charts, peak-season restrictions and whether your travel patterns match what the loyalty program offers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>When an Airline Card Makes Sense — and When It Doesn’t</h2>
      <p>If you fly often — especially internationally — and plan to redeem for flights or upgrades, a frequent-flyer card can pay off. The more you fly, the faster miles add up and the more value you can extract.</p>
      <p>But if you travel rarely or mostly domestically, accumulating enough miles for meaningful redemptions can take years. In that case, a flexible rewards or cashback card may deliver better net benefit than tying yourself to a single airline program.</p>
